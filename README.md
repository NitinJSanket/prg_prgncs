PRG's Setup of Intel Neural Compute Stick

## Setup Instructions
- Start afresh with new Ubuntu 16.04 as the NCS API requires its own version of OpenCV which conflicts with other OpenCV Installations
- Install Movidis SDK 2 from https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk. Basic Instructions are given below:
  - ```
    git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
    ```
  - ```
    make install
    ```


## Important Notes
- Only certain layers are supported and the list can be found [here](https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk/releases).
- Using deconvolution is twitchy and does not work with strides if `padding="same"` is used. Use `padding="valid"` for strided deconvolutions.
- The following tests were conducted on this architecture: <br> 
`Input -> Conv(8, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU) -> Conv(16, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU) -> Conv(16, 5x5, 2x2, same, ReLU) -> Deconv(X, 5x5, YxY, valid, None) -> Ouptut` <br> Where `Conv(8, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU)` means  a convolutional layer with 8 filters, 5x5 kernel sized convolutions, 1x1 strides, same padding and ReLU activation.
- A table of tests with varying parameters and their outputs are given below: <br>

| X (Number of Filters) | Y (Strides)  | Output Size | Result | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2 | 2 | 64x64x2 | Pass |
| 1 | 5 | 80x80x1 | Pass |
| 1 | 6 | 96x96x1 | Error 5 |
| 80 | 5 | 80x80x80 | Pass |
| 1000 | 5 | 80x80x1000 | Error 25 |
| 400 | 5 | 80x80x400 | Pass | 

Error messages are given below: <br>
```
