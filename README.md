PRG's Setup of Intel Neural Compute Stick

## Setup Instructions
- Start afresh with new Ubuntu 16.04 as the NCS API requires its own version of OpenCV which conflicts with other OpenCV Installations
- Install Movidis SDK 2 from https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk
  - ```
    git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
    ```
