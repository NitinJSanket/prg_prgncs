PRG's Setup of Intel Neural Compute Stick

## Setup Instructions
- Start afresh with new Ubuntu 16.04 as the NCS API requires its own version of OpenCV which conflicts with other OpenCV Installations
- Install Movidis SDK 2 from https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk. Basic Instructions are given below:
  - ```
    git clone -b ncsdk2 https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk.git
    ```
  - ```
    make install
    ```

## Troubleshooting

   1. If you get an Error on line 498, try to delete the movidius file in the `/opt/` folder and run `make install` again.

   2. If the problem persists, check the `PYTHONPATH` and it should point it to the `/opt/movidius/caffe` folder. If it is not, then edit the `~/.bashrc` file to include the following:
   `export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/opt/movidius/caffe/python"`

   3. If the `make examples` command also fails, then try to delete the folders that throw errors. For this installation we needed only tensorflow and hence deleted the folders `/caffe` inside `/examples` and `/multistick_cpp` inside `/examples/apps` and run `make install`.
   
   
   4. While running `make run` in the tensorflow examples, it might throw error with a `permission denied` exception. To solve this, change your permissions with the command:

      `chmod  755  -R /path/to/yourfolder`

## Running Code
- Change `BasePath` in `TrainIdentity.py` to point to the base directory of all CIFAR10 Images, for eg. `/home/ncs/Nitin/ncsdk/Nitin/SpectralCompression/CIFAR10`
- In the Folder `TxtFiles`, find and replace `/home/ncs/Nitin/ncsdk/Nitin/SpectralCompression/CIFAR10` with your path in both `DirNamesTrain.txt` and `DirNamesTest.txt`. This should be the same path as the first step
- Change Path on the first line in `RunNCS.sh`
- Train the network, convert to the form to be able to be read by NCS API, compile, profile and check code on NCS by running `./RunNCS.sh`. (Remember to give permissions first by using the command `sudo chmod -R 777 .`).
- Modify the Network in `Network/NetworkIdentity.py` making sure to follow the important notes given in this readme.

## Important Notes

- For custom built tensorflow networks please follow the compilation guide for it to be NCS compatible [here.](https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/tf_compile_guidance.html)
- Only certain layers are supported and the list can be found [here](https://github.com/movidius/ncsdk/releases).
- Using deconvolution is twitchy and does not work with strides if `padding="same"` is used. Use `padding="valid"` for strided deconvolutions.
- The following tests were conducted on this architecture: <br> 
`Input -> Conv(8, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU) -> Conv(16, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU) -> Conv(16, 5x5, 2x2, same, ReLU) -> Deconv(X, 5x5, YxY, valid, None) -> Ouptut` <br> Where `Conv(8, 5x5, 1x1, same, ReLU)` means  a convolutional layer with 8 filters, 5x5 kernel sized convolutions, 1x1 strides, same padding and ReLU activation.
- A table of tests with varying parameters and their outputs are given below: <br>

| X (Number of Filters) | Y (Strides)  | Output Size | Result | Inference Time (ms) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 2 | 4 | 65x65x2 | Pass | 1.99 |
| 1 | 5 | 80x80x1 | Pass | 1.95 |
| 1 | 6 | 96x96x1 | Error 5 | NA |
| 80 | 5 | 80x80x80 | Pass | 2.61 |
| 1000 | 5 | 80x80x1000 | Error 25 | NA |
| 400 | 5 | 80x80x400 | Pass | 6.76 |

Error messages are given below: <br>
- Error 5: 
```
[Error 5] Toolkit Error: Stage Details Not Supported: Wrong deconvolution output shape.
```

- Error 25: 
```
E: [         0] dispatcherEventReceive:236	dispatcherEventReceive() Read failed -4

E: [         0] eventReader:254	Failed to receive event, the device may have reset

E: [         0] ncFifoReadElem:2736	Failed to read fifo element

GetResult exception
[Error 25] Myriad Error: "Status.ERROR".
```

## Results

### USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0:

Same image was inferred for 1000 iterations, taking into account the **image loading time** using cv2.

## TODO
- [ ] Test by running custom model on NCS using API2
